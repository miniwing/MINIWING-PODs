#pragma mark Background colors

/* We provide two design systems (also known as "stacks") for structuring an iOS app's backgrounds.

 * of the main background, when appropriate.
 *
 * Inside of a discrete piece of UI, choose a stack, then use colors from that stack.
 * We do not recommend mixing and matching background colors between stacks.
 * The foreground colors above are designed to work in both stacks.
 *
 * 1. systemBackground
 *    Use this stack for views with standard table views, and designs which have a white
 *    primary background in light mode.

 *    colors in places where a table view wouldn't make sense.
